The fact that Ondov was such a pathetic excuse for a professor is testament to his ability to inspire righteous anger in even the most uninterested students like myself.  Where to begin?  First, his lectures.  Allow me to sum up every Ondov lecture you will ever attend: He will use a combination of powerpoint slides and blackboard work to teach.  The powerpoint slides are ripe with mistakes and errors that students point out merrily every class, as finding one of his ever-present screw-ups usually results in extra credit.  This is also known as \"bribing students to not talk about how many times I mess-up\"  When he turns to further explain the complicated problems on the blackboard, you might as well turn off all your senses because he is about to start sprouting gibberish and incoherent nonsense for about 5-10 minutes.  Whenever you see him turn around, rest assured he is actually entering his own little world where everything he says makes perfect sense and unicorns fly across the sky on rainbow bridges.  Trying to follow his thought process is almost as challenging as mustering your will to go to his class at all.  In addition, his droning monotonous voice combined with the difficulty of following his spastic \"teaching\" results in the lecture essentially becoming a way to catch up on sleep.  I\\'m telling you right now, the only reason to ever attend his lectures are for the clicker questions that his TA will give at the end of class as a quiz grade.  \\r\\nThank god for those TA\\'s.  Although some of them are extremely incompetent at grading your exams (which results in you having to meticulously go over your every test to get back your much-needed points) they literally carry the class on their backs with their discussion sections.  Pray for a good one.  \\r\\nHis office hours are really great if you love being talked down to and falling asleep in a chair.  Here\\'s a personal experience from me: I emailed him after the second exam asking to go over it with him.  He responded a speedy month later.  When I went there to learn how I made my mistakes, he assumed I just wanted him to look over his test for mistakes the TA\\'s made when grading (a testament to the number of problems they cause and his disinterest in helping his students).  He looked over my first couple problems and determined that my TA had actually given me more points then I should have.  He then proceed to LOWER my grade on the exam on his computer when I came to him for HELP in UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL. A more obnoxious thing to do to a student who comes to you for help I cannot imagine. I shouldn\\'t end this review without saying at least one positive thing about him as much as he deserves it. Unfortunately, I can\\'t think of one yet.\\r\\nAnother one of his great habits is changing the classroom and not telling the students until the last minute, or not at all.  As much fun as going back and forth across the campus is, I just want to learn Chem. \\r\\nI don\\'t want you to think I took this class with no effort on my own either. It was the second time I was taking the class, and I have had a private chem tutor for a year and a half.  I still was getting 60\\'s on his exams.  \\r\\nMy best advice for taking is class is this: I hope you are good at teaching yourself material because he sure won\\'t.  Read the textbooks, do the practice problems and maybe you won\\'t be completely lost.  That guy who posted beneath me may have the right idea about it not being high school anymore, but that doesn\\'t really help when you\\'re professor is incapable of getting the material across to you.  He is right about another thing too, Ondov knows his chemistry.  Unfortunately, that doesn\\'t mean jack when he might as well be teaching the class in another language due to his total inability to teach.  Also he might be Ondov himself.

Since it is an English class, attendance is mandatory (and boy is it painful).  Most of his classes consist of him half-heartedly going over the assignments and then talking about nothing for the rest of the class.  He is extremely meek and soft spoken.  He is also very indirect when asking people to do things.  He has an extremely specific way of sending him emails and assignments and if you don\\'t follow his format perfectly, you get points off, which is ridiculous.\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the year, he said he would focus on the content of your writing, not the grammar or little mistakes.  HOW WRONG THIS IS.  In all of the assignments, he took off for the small things such as missed commas or a misspelled word.  This leads me to my next point.  Out of the 6 assignments in the class, we only got the grades back from 2 of them before the class ended.  How are we supposed to know where to improve if we have no feedback?\\n\\r\\nThe class consisted of 6 assignments.\\n\\r\\nThe first assignment was a rhetorical analysis of a paper that you had written prior to the class.  Let me start by saying Winett is obsessed with these rhetorical analyses.  I believe they are some of the most pointless assignments I have done in my 3 years at Maryland.  They are hard to explain without you seeing them, but they are basically just restating what the purpose of the original assignment is.\\n\\r\\nThe second assignment is an analysis of a peer-reviewed journal article.  Luckily, the article doesn\\'t have to be about economics and can be about anything.  This assignment wasn\\'t that bad.  Basically, it was just an analysis of the different parts of a journal article based on the criteria that Winett created.\\n\\r\\nThe third assignment was a planning memo.  This was another one of those stupid rhetorical analysis papers.  This time, it was related to the final paper, which I will get to in a little bit.\\n\\r\\nThe fourth assignment was a resume and cover letter.  I thought this would be easy because I already had a resume and cover letter that had gotten me multiple interviews and offers with some of the biggest names on Wall St and in the accounting world, but in all actuality, it was completely different than what I thought.  I had a resume and cover letter based on the templates provided by the Office of Career Services at the business school.  However, this was not sufficient for Winett.  Unless our job experience was directly related to the job we were applying for, Winett wanted us to delete our work experience and instead put in statements of what we had done in our classes.  For the last 3 years, I have been taught to NEVER EVER do that because everyone takes the same classes and does the same thing.  I have been taught that any work experience is good to put on the resume because it shows you can hold a job and can ultimately relate to a different job (ie. restaurant job = experience in a fast paced environment, working with deadlines, etc).  Also, we had to do a stupid rhetorical analysis for our resume and cover letter too, which was again completely pointless.\\n\\r\\nThe fifth assignment was a persuasive presentation.  It might as well have been any kind of presentation you want, because ultimately Winett didn\\'t give two shits about what you talked about as long as you gave the audience an \"experience\".  I honestly think Winett didn\\'t care if it was persuasive or not.  Every time we talked about the presentations in class, he always talked about giving the audience an \"experience\", but never about how to persuade the audience.  Most of the presentations ended up being informative presentations about some hobby that the student was interested in, but he seemed to love them because they got the audience involved and gave them an \"experience\".  Don\\'t forget, we had to write a freaking rhetorical analysis for this too.\\n\\r\\nLast but not least, the sixth assignment was a journal document.  This meant we were to write an article that would be published in an undergraduate peer-reviewed journal.  This is the biggest assignment of the course, and he spent forever talking about it.  However when he talked about it, he never really said anything useful.  This project was such a pain.  Of course, lest you forget, we had to write a rhetorical analysis for this too.\\n\\r\\nOverall, DO NOT EVER TAKE A COURSE WITH WINETT.  He is a terrible professor.

Today you wrote on the board a function W without (as far as I could tell) saying what W was. Another example from today was <mathematical formula not shown here>, which to me was very confusing because I\\'m not sure what was meant by the bar, which did not seem like standard use of notation to me.\\n\\r\\n-I would appreciate it if the goals of the analysis were more explicit. I have heard \"the game you play\" or \"what you have to do\" followed by a short explanation of the next step in the analysis, but the reasoning behind that step or what it will get us on the way is often not explicit.\\n\\r\\n-I have some difficulty understanding the motivation behind some of the goals of the analysis. Sometimes we will calculate the entropy or some other thermodynamic quantity of something, but the treatment is very abstract. While this affords a nice degree of generality, it is difficult to keep in mind what the quantities actually say about such an abstract system. It may be helpful to make references during calculations to a real physical system, even if it is just an ideal gas in a box or something of that nature.\\n\\r\\n-There has not seemed to have been thus far much explicit coherence among the topics we have discussed, no obvious thread of commonality or narrative to the content.

There is one \"project\" which is a mock research paper on lab 3, which is about diodes. There are homeworks (other than pre-labs) that involve finishing parts of this paper. She\\'ll put comments on your HWs and then not properly explain them. I think she doesn\\'t completely understand significant figures, which I feel is a problem with a lot of physicists/astronomers. I\\'m not sure what she wants but it apparently isn\\'t what is taught in chemistry. The class isn\\'t that difficult but MAKE SURE that you always state, in complete sentences and in markdown, all measurements with uncertainty. This was not properly communicated at the beginning of the course.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe labs are not bad, and they\\'re pretty interesting. You learn useful skills in the class. The TA grades all the labs, so your grade\\'s accuracy is mostly dependent on how good the TA is. My TA was not great.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one exam, which was the \"final exam\" (though it happens the week before finals). You get a few extra minutes at the end to finish up, if you need. There are two parts: 1.) building a simple circuit, taking data on it, and analyzing that data, and 2.) a written part about the different circuits/components you learned about. The first part is pretty easy; just make sure you know how ground and the ground isolation unit works. You will most likely need to use the ground isolation unit. The written part was ok overall, but some of the questions were curveballs. For example, when you use the oscilloscope, the different channels have different colors, and this is the main way in which you identified different channels. One of the exam questions was an image of the oscilloscope screen in black and white, and you had to identify the channels using other information on the screen. She gave us equations and things to know on some slides, but it should have included more info. One example is the formula for phase shift between two functions/oscilloscope channels, which you should probably already know, but anyway it should have been included. It\\'s ωΔt = 2*pi*f*Δt. On the day of the exam, she mentioned that the exam should be something you don\\'t really have to study for, and one that you should be able to just walk in and do well on because it\\'s just info we\\'ve been doing all semester. It\\'s true that it wasn\\'t bad, but it wasn\\'t trivial either. That just shows how she expects us to have her level of knowledge.

The only things I had to focus on were lab assignments and modules. The lab assignment criteria was clear on what you had to do for the programming, and the lectures that the professor teaches in class alongside the problem sets given to you help you get an understanding on how to use/execute specific coding for each assignment. Even though the problem sets are not required to complete, it is better to do them before doing the assignment since they provide an overview on what you need to do for said assignment. The practice modules are rather straightforward and easy to complete since you go to Data Camps and watch videos of programming for different Python related topics, then complete basic assignments that follow up with the videos. The modules are rather simplistic to do and easy points to earn for the class, as well as providing knowledge on Python programming. Overall, the course was good during the beginning of the semester, however, things went bad when during the middle of the semester, the professor decided to do quizzes in a PROGRAMMING CLASS, and he said that this was the first time he ever attempted to do such a thing. There was only 5 quizzes, however, they were worth more than the lab assignments, as well as the fact that the quizzes are not multiple choice, rather they are composed of PROGRAMMING, where we had less than an hour to write and execute coding to complete specific requirements. What made it worse was the fact that all of the quizzes focused on the harder topics that we barely covered in class one week beforehand. By the end of the semester, a lot of students in the class had a significant drop in their grades (including myself) due to the quizzes killing all of our grades. Dr. Oshan should either remove the quizzes from the grading criteria altogether or make the quizzes be focused on the easier topics, otherwise, the course is not worth it unless it is mandatory for your specific major or you are a Python programming expert.', 'rating': 3, 'expected_grade': 'B-', 'created': '2022-01-20T00:29:01Z'}], 'name': 'Taylor Oshan', 'slug': 'oshan'}\n",

In fact the description is so off base I think what is happening here should be looked into by the ACES program. The labs are very surface level and I'm sure if you've taken the prereq ACES courses, much of this material will not be new to you. I was not a fan of the lecture style, which often involved just playing some youtube videos of how to use software and reading off the slides, when at the very least he could've done a live demonstration. It would just be easier to have this class be asynchronous. The final project is a large research paper, of which you choose any cybersecurity relevant topic and relate it back to forensics. It basically has nothing to do with the material we've been going over, yet writing this paper is a very large focus of the class. For the lectures that have happened so far, all the material feels very jumpy and doesn't really make sense how it relates to this class. There also haven't really been any cases of applying lecture to technical assignments. A lot of offensive security is being taught, and very very little about actual digital forensics. It feels like I'm taking an intro to offensive cybersecurity class, which would be cool if this wasn't a 400-level elective about digital forensics.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd hope this can all be chalked up to lack of preparation on when this course was assigned to him, since Testudo had TBA until just a few weeks before the semester start. If this was his decision to make the course less technical, it really should be changed back. The whole appeal of many ACES electives and classes is to dive into more niche cybersecurity fields that wouldn't be covered in general computer science courses. I think he's a good guy and is trying to make this course cover all the basics of cybersecurity so no one is left behind, but it's pretty frustrating to have a HACS class that was displayed as heavily technical and nuanced being reduced to this.
